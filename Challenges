SECOND WEEK CHALLENGES:
(TECHNICAL CHALLENGES )
- I struggled to find an app builder that was easy to use and free for status, I kept on trying different app builders and some where no longer in use so it was hectic for with a short time like this knowing that this is my first time creating an app. I wanted to use different coding languages but i couldnt do it. I was so hard especially with javascript this time.
